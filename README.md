A really basic experiment to learn how typescript works or behave when managing databases, i know its not the best but was an excercise of my scoolarship that the have left me to do

### Feel free to improve it, use it and whatever you want!

### Structure of the files:
![strcutdshfjdkshfdseschemabakanardoasibienfinolingo](/images/schema.png)

### Things to keep in mind:
- all the code use dotenv to protect the credentials (thats silly bcs all is running on local but i want it to put it xD)
- the form of the data push on json will be on this structure;
   - title {
   - director {
   - year {
   - genres ["",""]
