## Hey, welcome back mate
A small collection of APIs (just one, i mean its only a Movie API) with different packages and DBs divided into folders with their respective levels

### Structure of the files:

### Things to keep in mind:
- all the code use dotenv to protect the credentials (thats silly bcs all is running on local but i want it to put it xD)
- the form of the data push on json will be on this structure;
   - "title": {}
   - "director": {}
   - "year": {}
   - "genres": ["",""]
